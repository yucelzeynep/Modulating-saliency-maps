This folder contains the templates of following documents delivered to the participants.

* Informed consent 
* Instructions (for free-view, use, and push)

Note that we release an English and a Japanese version for each file. However, the English version is provided only 
with the purpose of increasing accessibility, and the versions that we used in the experiments are the ones in Japanese.
Since all participants were Japanese nationals, they filled in the documents in their mother tongue.
